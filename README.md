# ManipuSim
A custom engine for simulating robotic manipulators, that is also my bachelor's thesis.  
Currently implemented features:
- simulation of highly redundant open-loop kinematic chains
- static and dynamic environments
- simulation of path planning algorithms: RRT, ARRT, genetic algorithm and more to come.

Platform: .NET Core / C#  
Graphics: [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk)  
Tested on: Windows 10, Ubuntu 20.04 (partially)
